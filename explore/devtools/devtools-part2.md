1. The bug was that the user input was being treated as a string and it was supposed to be treated as a integer.
2. The way I would fix this is by making sure that num1 and num2 were being treated as integers
and to do this I would use the javascript function parseInt that converts the user's input into a string. This is how the code loosk with the fix.
