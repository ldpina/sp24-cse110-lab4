1. <br> 3, because it returns the value of i where the for loop ended.
2. <br> 150, because it will return the last value of the 'prices' variable and its applied discount, so the person would get -$150 off the oringal purchase.
3. <br> 150, because it will return the final price of the last value of 'prices' so 300-150 = 150.
4. <br> [ 50, 100, 150 ],This will return an array of all items in 'prices' with the discount provided applied to them.
5. <br>  You would get an erorr because all the variables were intialized with let and the memory is not carried over outside of its use, so since the print statement is outside of the for loop it does not have access to the value stored in i.
6. <br>  An error would would occur in the same way as the last question, line 13 would throw an error since dicountedPrice was intialized with let and it was inside of a for loop where line 13 does not have access to.
7. <br>  150, This happens because finalPrice was intialized outside of the for loop so the memory was able to be saved and can be refrenced to all throughout the program.
8. <br>  [ 50, 100, 150 ], This is returned because it is the array of all items with their discounted prices and the way it works is by having values being pushed to an array that can be refrenced to throughout the whole function.
9. <br>  This would throw an error because the variable i was intialized within the for loop and the memory cannot be accessed outside of the loop.
10. <br>  3, this happens because the length variable was instialized at the begining of the function and can be refrenced throughout the function.
11. <br> [ 50, 100, 150 ], this happens because all discounted prices were pushed to the discountedPrices array and although it is a const, as long as the data types are the same we are free to add or remove more numbers.
12. <br> 
  a. student.name <br> 
  b. student['Grad Year'] <br> 
  c. student.greeting() <br> 
  d. student['Favorite Teacher'].name <br> 
  e. student.courseLoad[0] <br> 
13. <br> 
  a. <br>  '32', This happens because the '+' symbol assumes we are trying to add 2 to ur string so it absorbs the number into the string
  b. 1, <br> 
  c. 3, <br> 
  d. '3null', <br> 
  e. 4, <br> 
  f. 0, <br> 
  g. '3undefined', <br> 
  h. NaN <br> 
14. <br> 
  a. true, <br> 
  b. false, js goes in lexiographical order so since it sees that the first number in '12' is 1 it determines that it is lower than 2 and should come before '2'. <br> 
   c. true <br> 
  d. false <br> 
  e. false <br> 
  f. true <br> 
15. <br> a
16. <br> a
17. <br> a
18. <br> a
19. <br> a
